# Jenkins Exporter

An exporter for [Jenkins](https://jenkins-ci.org) metrics. It exposes certain build 
related metrics like the job's build time in a Prometheus compliant format.

This exporter polls periodically a single Jenkins Master via the 
[Jenkins remote API](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Remote+access+API) in order
to offer the metrics to Prometheus.

*Please note that this code was initially inspired (i.e. copied ;-) by [collectd_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/collectd_exporter). 
I guess any similarity will vanish over time, though. All credits for the kickoff are due to the Prometheus team ;-)*
